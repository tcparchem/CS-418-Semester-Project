# CS-418-Semester-Project
Analysis of Fire Start Data

The goal of this project is to  compare and contrast how wildfires have started and the impacts of humans versus environmental started fires. The idea is to predict and analyze the trends of how fires started, their impact on their location, and the trends over time. Some questions include:
1. With the recent rise in the number of wildfires across the United States, what is the relationship between man made wildfires and naturally occurring wildfires that occur in sparks of dry weather and droughts?
2. Across the United States, has there been an increase in man made wildfires over the past few decades?
3. Can environmentally started fire damage be mitigated by pre-emptive action? 


Dataset: Oregon State University has collected and provided merged data from multiple fire agencies in the U.S. & Canada. The included data comes from the following agencies: FWFOD, NFO, NIFC, FPA-FOD, CNFDB. Each of these agencies’ websites provides users with the ability to query, research and download wildland fire occurrence data collected by Federal land management agencies for fires that occurred from 1986 through 2013. The final OSU website data comes in a .csv file and contains many column attributes regarding the cause, location, start date, etc., of the fires. The .csv file can be easily translated into a Pandas dataframe for analysis.
